Vera and I sat down and did a rain check on our
lifestyles to date. I was living out of a suitcase so radical changes were
made. I joined Saville Tractors at Marsh Barton as a Workshop Supervisor and
life continued normally until two things happened. Unexpectedly I was quickly
promoted to Service Manager and the company became main dealers of Listers of
Dursley, Glos. This was just a homecoming for me because when I was an
agricultural engineer in my early days the Company held a Lister Generator
Dealership so I was very familiar with the product. So instead of
familiarisation from scratch I immediately ran with the ball and put a small
team together repairing Start O Matic generators and moved into this marginal
mains failure generation winning contracts to install and service units for the
shop retail industry. We did have the service contract for Devon and Cornwall
Police radio hilltop sites. Then one morning there was a major announcement –
we had been taken over by a large conglomerate called Lonhro and Exeter was to
change into a Sales and Service Centre for heavy German lorries M-A-N and
Volkeswagon commercial vehicles.

I stood in my office looking into space and thinking all my working life I had
worked in the world where we judge reliability of services required by hours
worked and now we entered the world of miles operated and as I stood there that
morning I had no idea of what was a good or a bad performance. Nevertheless
the boys were selected in their respective product team to meet the challenge
and meet it they did as proof the M-A-N Volkeswagon Company ran an inter-dealer
competition involving technical questions and performance on call out section
and my boys won the Gold Team award I think 5 years running. One award was a
visit to Castle Coombe in Wiltshire to try out race driving skills on Formula
Ford racing and clay pigeon shooting, enough awards to muster confidence.
Policies changed within the Lonhro Group and it was not the thing to operate a
service operation. For the first time in my life I was made redundant.

I then moved into a different world of sales and parts promotion of Lister
components to plant hire companies and the sale of marine engines in boat yards
and yacht marinas throughout the south of England. This was a very
satisfactory occupation for me as the company Sleeman Hawken had the ability to
provide and supply parts overnight so it was great to speak to a customer with
confidence. This opened up new avenues. I got the
contract to carry all Hilltop Radio Station general enquiries for Devon \&
Cornwall Police.

Having changed my lifestyle of working to the present normal
weekly hours I immediately started to put into place my deep wish and mirror my
Grandfather's life to become a bee keeper. So I began to purchase and put
together equipment for the required need from a great friend of mine, Bill
Smith of Exeter Bee Supplies. So I was well into bee keeping with 17 hives, 2
W.B.Cs, the rest national hives, 4 located on the roof of the deep freeze room
in my home and some in Days Pottles Lane, Exminster near Exeter and some beside
the railway line on Marsh Barton. We would spin the honey into honey plastic
buckets which would hold about 1 cwt. With the vast mix of trees around
Middlemore the quality of the honey was exceptional.
A shock response greeted me one evening when I was stung in the face quite by
chance like it or not and I pretended it did not happen. A trip to the
hospital was very necessary resulting in the solemn advice that stings over 14
years had built up so I was strongly advised to give up and get rid of the bees
before they got rid of me. This was a shock to my system but nevertheless I
was thankful that I had had the experience of keeping bees.

One day I was asked to assist in the filming of Lion of the Desert as there were
no Fiat or MAN track vehicles and for work in the desert, real track vehicles
were required. I was shown a print of an original tank as they required an
immediate answer on the spot in the office from me. Yes was given and I drove
back from Cornwall designing the complete unit in my head. I stepped out of
the car at Exeter Depot and requested a used International 125 from the sales
fleet, drove home in the evening and commenced to carry out drawings covering
the intended conversion. The next day the crew continued with normal
dealership duties whilst 2 service men cleaned at speed and washed the floor
which had dried whilst the donor dozer was stripped of dozer blade, all frame
work, operator cab, fuel tank and bonnet. By evening the floor was dried out
and the track power unit squared into position. The 3 men assistants were sent
home for tea anticipating that they would have a complete mindset. In the
meantime I carried out chalk drawings on the floor using nothing more than a
tape measure, square and plain metal straight edges. You must understand as it
came out of my head there was no heavy or sophisticated calculation but I knew
of the benefit of the likeness to the track configuration must follow the
original drawings. When completed the film crew came down to Exeter with our
hearts thumping to test in a very rough field and that afternoon well proved
itself so the heart thumping changed to back slapping. You can imagine the
sales team thinking Christmas had come again when the film company ordered the
conversion of 5 extra units. I understand they went on their way to carry out
the filming. You will find Lion of the Desert in detail on Google and if you
scroll down to `military equipment used' you will see a full photo of my Fiat 2
MAN tank conversions with various comments from military experts still trying
to identify the type of tank used. It was nothing like they guessed it to be
but came out of my head and was made by the boys of Exeter from an
International 125 so years passed and the holding financial Company started
closing and made all the MAN engineers redundant but retaining some of the
generator maintenance engineers. I was then made redundant. Fortunately having
observed the action taken over the past months I had a position waiting for me.
When I walked into the Job Centre it became apparent that I was the wise man
with still a young attitude. I thought what a pity it was that the Job Centre
employed people unable to identify and communicate by using a different
attitude with people that had worked all their lives and were made redundant
for the first time and those with no knowledge of what to do regarding
redundancy and the inefficient waster.




Bye bye Savilles --- Good day Sleeman Hawkins: I commenced this job working
from home working with the Company as a Parts Engineer and Marine sales. I
could carry out my customer PR visits with great confidence knowing that any
Lister Petter parts ordered would be with the customer within a day or so.

The area I travelled was Cornwall to Poole RNLI Headquarters at Malmsbury and
Wales M4 and the Gower Peninsula. Vera and I would load the van with 3 Lister
Marine engines and show kit and depart on Sundays or Bank Holidays in the
morning, arrive at Newlyn fish market and build up a complete marine engine
show stand.

We were ready for the Newlyn fish festival that commenced on Bank Holiday Monday
a very popular event that drew in approximately 22,000 visitors. That day
engines sold would be followed up with a visit to the installation site. How
useful my past training in Geneva came into play. We would follow by having a
stand in the NEC at Birmingham and one in Lyme Regis. Eventually I retired
with Vera following 2 years later.

I was well pleased to be able to load 3 Lister marine engines and show kit into
my Astra van. This was achieved because I owned a three piece breakdown engine
lift and on weekends was able to check out Health and Safety with fingers on
the buzzers, ie I manufactured an extension on the lifting arm so angled that
it lay parallel with the engine thus manoeuvring the clearance between the
engine rocker cover to the height of the van roof. With my minimising engine
lift I was self-contained and able to load.






I then retired and have spent some days on my yacht moored at Dittisham on the
River Dart. I had spent my working days trouble shooting motor vessels and
decided to have peace and quiet so I purchased a little Super Seal 26' yacht
and have spent time sailing the south coast --- Dartmouth to Salcombe or
Dartmouth to Exmouth --- nothing too taxing as I have accomplished that.

As I did not want to close down completely after an active life Vera and I
decided to volunteer as speakers for Devon Air Ambulance so we have travelled
across the county of Devon, me standing out in front as a speaker and Vera
working the laptop power point unit. We started 16 years ago, acknowledged the
challenges needed to keep up to date with cost and expansion. I have been an
auctioneer selling cakes, bread, jars of jam and marmalade until the pandemic
closed power point operations.
When Vera and I enjoyed our Ruby wedding anniversary we invited friends and
relatives to a Sunday lunch with a request for no presents but if they wished
to put a donation for the Devon Air Ambulance in a bucket, that would be
appreciated. The following morning we delivered the bucket  to the Devon Air
Ambulance HQ to be opened. It was an exceptional surprise to find generous
amounts of money had been donated. We were then asked if we could help as
there was a shortage of speakers. Vera said, ``Mike will be a speaker''. So
from then on I became a speaker and Vera and I always worked as a Devon Air
Ambulance team of speakers, Vera operating the Power Point system whilst I
spoke. This we continued to do until the Covid 19 lockdown. In the previous
16 years we had given talks at the length and breadth of Devon manning stalls
at shows and in the latter period Vera worked in the garden whilst I spent time
in the garage/workshop making leather swords, fobs and belts as I had taught
myself leather work at the beginning of my story when I mentioned a very young
John Anstee who would spend much time with me as an engineer who controls a
welding and engineering business of his own. We spent many hours discussing
engineering projects from the latest to the old types of problems and carried
out modifications to a great friend's son's new kit car.

Vera and I have had great fortune in having such lovely people around us to keep
our early retirement alive, such as Julie, first cousin to Vera and Godmother
to Julie's daughter, and her husband Richard, who both chaperoned us to five
unbelievable holidays on Lake Garda and then to Venice and to Florence in
Tuscany and kept a close watch on us at all times. Also John and Ann Anstee
now identifying that the old joints need an extra grease nipple fitted together
with an extra squirt of WD40, collect us and take us for Sunday lunch and the
everlasting friendship of Judy and Gordon Long ever ready to present a meal and
our very many friends and acquaintances.

To cast my mind back in time I was introduced to John Anstee by his Mum, Elsie
when I was 15 years of age. He was a babe in arms and as you can imagine we
lost touch over the years until the 1990s when John carried out a specialist
stainless steel welding upgrade on my Super Seal 26 boat rudder. Now standing
before me is this very experienced welder with all metal type experience. From
that time on we sailed on the south coast and carried out mooring repairs at
the Ham, Dittisham thus extending our happy boating life until Covid 19 hit the
world.

We were very lucky because we Caterpillar men, known as the CAT men had not met
for 49 years so I set forth with pen and phone and arranged a reunion on 15
February 2020 which developed into a great event at the Beefeater, Middlemoor
with Devon Life sitting with us and interviewing us all and put us in Google.
As a band of brothers we had the following boys, Joe Morrish aged 94 who was
Depot Service Controller, Jack Carter, Depot Parts Manager and Colin Wroth,
Engine Rebuild Supervisor. Also there was Bob Richards aged 70ish, Depot
Overseas Service Engineer, John Cole aged 80, Depot and overseas Service
Engineer, Johnny Blackmore aged 72 and myself as Field Service Engineer. We
both worked the length of theM5, part of the M4, Telegraph Hill and I did a
section of the Plymouth Highway whilst Johnny Blackmore accompanied by the late
Tony Butt continued to manage the Plympton site and sometimes I would break
from duty to engage on marine work as discussed earlier in my story.

I also remember being in daily contact with Gordon Long. One day I was
contacted by Poltimore Church warden in desperation for a replacement old
fashioned church key. I told him that I would make a replacement. Having
never made a key before I thought this should be interesting so I examined the
old 8 feet long item and selected the metal required. I set forth with quite
an amount of hand hacksawing followed by an equal amount of small filing and it
came to pass that a key presented itself. I ended up making 2 or 3 more for
Poltimore and one for Huxham Church. I returned them with the completion of
the regular 2.5 inches and ¼'' key rings as I remembered at Sunday School in
Cheriton Bishop Mrs Hill explaining that all church keys should have a 2.5 inch
key ring for should the bridegroom or best man forget the wedding ring the
vicar would call the Church Warden to hand over the church key and the special
ring was placed on the bride's finger and duly blessed so three good things
came out of the manufacturing of the keys. The Church Committees were not
overladen with the cost of a replacement key though these keys were approved of
by the old customers. Two Church Wardens had been re-educated to cope with
modern day weddings should the unthinkable happen.
